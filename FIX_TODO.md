# TODO: Fix student-access.html 404 and Data Sync Issues

## Tasks:
- [x] 1. Create student-access.html entry point that redirects to student.html
- [x] 2. Update vite.config.js to include student-access as new entry point
- [x] 3. Build the project
- [x] 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
- [x] 5. Verify the student-access.html URL works (HTTP 200 confirmed!)
- [x] 6. Fix Grade Entry - no students showing issue

## Issues Fixed:
- Issue 1 (FIXED): student-access.html now returns HTTP 200 on GitHub Pages and Firebase
- Issue 2 (FIXED): Grade Entry now selects first available course by default
- Data sync: Already works - Admin Dashboard auto-syncs to Firebase on every change
